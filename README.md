# Testing

Unit tests can be easily run with the command `npm test`.

The integration tests require Postgres and Redis instances. The simplest way to run the tests locally is with `docker-compose`.

```
$ git secret reveal
$ npm run test:compose
```

You can also run tests locally against Postgres and Redis instances running in `docker-compose`:
```
$ git secret reveal
$ npm run compose
$ export INTEGRATION_OUTREACH_SIGNATURE_KEY=$(cat .balena/secrets/integration_outreach_signature_key)
$ REDIS_HOST=localhost POSTGRES_HOST=localhost npm run test:integration
```

You can also access these Postgres and Redis instances:
```
$ PGPASSWORD=docker psql -hlocalhost -Udocker
$ redis-cli -h localhost
```
